Project description: This program is designed to determine the fraction from usersâ€™ input is proper fraction or improper fraction. 
If users input improper fraction, the program will work as a scientific calculator and display it under mixed fraction form or integer, if the numerator is divisible by the denominator. 

Input: Numerator and denominator of a fraction.
Output: proper fraction / improper fraction (mixed fraction) / whole number.
Comment: I use double type then cast the result to int type because I want to avoid error when the input is decimal number. 
However, the result will be incorrect if the input is decimal number.
For the sake of this assignment, I consider fraction is rational number which numerator and denominator are integers!
I sent you an email about this problem, but you haven't replied. 
This assignment is due tonight so I will submit this solution to the best of my knowledge!
